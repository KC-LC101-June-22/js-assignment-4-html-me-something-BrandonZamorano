                <h2>Learning</h2>
                <p>Learning is something that I think everyone enjoys.I believe 
                that everyone likes to improve themselves and get better at 
                something and that goes for me as well. I enjoy learning. I 
                enjoy the process of making mistakes, doing the work to improve, 
                and especially those moments when things just click and you 
                understand something that you had previosuly struggled with. I 
                imagine weight lifters enjoy a similar feeling when they reach 
                a new personal best. That being said, I don't enjoy learning 
                just <em>anything</em> without a reason or interest.</p>

                <p>That's how I felt about learning math during high school. I 
                didn't really know or have a way to apply my math skills then, 
                but now I do after decided to pursue programming. Needless to 
                say, now that I've seen interesting applications that require 
                math, I've decided to relearn what I forgot and progress my math 
                skills.</p>

                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>The thought of being able to create things with just a 
                computer was what caught my interest. I already had a computer 
                and access to a variety of resources thanks to the internet. I 
                didn't have to buy anything else, so I figured I might as well 
                try it out.</p>

                <p>After writing my first "Hello world!" program, I was hooked. 
                I could tell the computer to do what I need it to do. The only 
                thing limiting me was my knowledge. In other words, I think 
                learning about programming, fueled my interest in learning in 
                general.</p>
