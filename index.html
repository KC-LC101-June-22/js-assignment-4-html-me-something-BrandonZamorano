           <h1>My Hobbies and Intests:</h1>
           <p>People may have a variety of different hobbies. Some like to run 
           while others my prefer going out for a walk. Others may like to draw,
           while others may like to read or write. While my hobbies may not be 
            as exciting as snowboarding or parachuting, I will tell you about 
           a few of my hobbies and interests.</p>

               <h2>Learning</h2>
               <p>People may enjoy learning or dread it depending on their 
               frame of mind and past experiences. Personally I enjoy 
               learning because I enjoy the process of improving and those 
               moments when things click and you understand something that 
               you had had previously struggled with.</p>

               <p>I think another reason why I enjoy learning is because it 
               unlocks new opportunities. If you learn a new language, then you 
               may be able to communicate with more people than you were 
               previousle able to. Recently I've set out to improve my math 
               skills and understanding because I have some ways to apply it 
               now, and I know that it'll be useful in learning other things.</p>
